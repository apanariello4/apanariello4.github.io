      institution: AImageLab @ University of Modena and Reggio Emilia
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Developed a deep learning based software for the detection of video anomalous activities on public transport for the pan-European project **InSecTT**.
        - Studied and investigated techniques for data imbalance mitigation in anomaly detection problems.
        - Introduced a novel consistency-based regulation loss for temporal anomaly localization in self-supervised learning settings.
        - Developing of new techniques for video anomaly detection and video explaination using VAEs.
    - title: Head of Computer Division
      institution: MMR Driverless - Formula Student Team
      year: 2019-2021
      description:
        - Construction of a dataset of traffic cones consisting of four classes and 9000 images, with which a neural network has been fine-tuned to perform cones detection in images.
        - Developing of a deep learning based software for autonomous car perception based on cameras and Lidar sensors. The car is able to accurately detect the color and precise distance of traffic cones that define the track, in a 180Â° FOV ahead.
        - Project manager for the computer division.

    - title: Intern
      institution: Mivia Lab @ University of Salerno
      year: 2018
      description:
        Developed "ARPosture" (Swift) for the thesis work. The app was presented to the head of the Apple Developer Academy, being among the top 5 best apps developed at the University of Salerno in 2017-2019.
