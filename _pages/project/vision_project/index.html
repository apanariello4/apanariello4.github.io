The detection of the three objects is performed with a custom trained YOLOv3 network, while the retrieval is done by ORB keypoints. For the rectification we exploit the keypoints obtained by the ORB to find the homography matrix. Once we have found the paintings and the people we can localize the latter by getting the localization of the painting. The direction in which the person is facing is computed by a face detection and assuming that if the person is not looking at the camera then he is facing a painting. We also process screenshots from a 3D model of the museum, replacing paintings with high quality images from a database, using an inverse approach w.r.t the rectification one.</p> <h2 id="retrieval-and-rectification">Retrieval and Rectification</h2> <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apanariello4/vision-project/master/report/pictures/painting_rectification/rectification.png" alt="Retrieval and Rectification"></p> <h1 id="features">Features</h1> <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Painting detection:</strong> predict a ROI for each painting <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Statue detection:</strong> predict a ROI for each statue</li> </ul> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Painting rectification:</strong> correct the perspective distortion of each painting</li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Painting retrieval:</strong> match each detected painting to the paintings DB</li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>People detection:</strong> predict a ROI around each person <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Face detection:</strong> determine whether each person is facing a painting</li> </ul> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>People localization:</strong> assign each person to one of the rooms of the Gallery</li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked><strong>Painting replacing:</strong> replace a painting of a view from the 3D model with its corresponding picture in the paintings DB, appropriately deformed to match the 3D view</li> </ul> </body></html>
