I am Aniello Panariello, a Ph.D. student affiliated with the [AImageLab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/) research group at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, under the guidance of [Prof. Simone Calderara](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/person.asp?idpersona=38), I am immersed in exploring Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques. My prior experience includes leading the Computer Division for the Formula Student Team - MMR Driverless, where I focused on enhancing the perception capabilities of an autonomous racing car.


My research journey has evolved to focus on several advanced areas in machine learning. Currently, I am deeply engaged in **Continual Learning**, where I develop methods that enable models to learn continuously from a stream of data without forgetting previous knowledge. I also explore **Transfer Learning**, aiming to leverage knowledge from one domain to improve performance in another. Additionally, my work in **Compositionality** involves creating models that can understand and generate complex structures from simpler components. Lastly, I am investigating **Zero-Shot Models**, which are designed to make accurate predictions for tasks they have never seen before. Through these endeavors, I strive to push the boundaries of what machine learning models can achieve, particularly in scenarios with limited resources.

Previously I focused on **Monocular Distance Estimation**, a challenging area where I explore methods to accurately gauge distances using single-camera inputs, and **Video Anomaly Detection**, a field focused on identifying unusual human activities within video clips. In both domains, I employed innovative unsupervised and weakly supervised methods to maximize the utility of limited annotations while contributing to advancing these cutting-edge technologies.
